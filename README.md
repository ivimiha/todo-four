Another amazing project for the todo app. After four todo apps, and I might add one more to the list, I will start working on my own todo app.

In this project we did the usual stuff, I can see the patterns already for creating CRUD apps (or at least patterns for creating a todo app haha). So, usual stuff, create components, 3 of them for each item of the todo app: form, list and the todo. We added some new functionalities for focusing automatically by using useRef and useEffect components. Very cool.

Styling for the app was amazing, I will definately start working on Figma, maybe play around a bit just to create my own Todo app, it will be fun.
